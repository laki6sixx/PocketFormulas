Pocket Formulas
==============

This is the source code of my android app Pocket Formulas :) <br/>
I know there are bugs, so if you want to help me fix them, write me an email with the solutions here:
- laki6sixx@gmail.com <br/>

The formulas are rendered with the MathJax library: 
- http://www.mathjax.org/

For help around the MathJax library, visit this link:

The formulas are written in res/values/strings.xml file, then displayed through the Java Files.
